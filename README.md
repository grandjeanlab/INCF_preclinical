Practical guide to overcome the reproducibility crisis in small animal neuroimaging: workflows, tools, and repositories
Chairs: Markus Aswendt, Joanes Grandjean
Location: Presentation Room 1

The workshop will include interactive seminars given by selected experts in the field covering all aspects of (FAIR) small animal MRI data acquisition, analysis, and sharing. The seminars will be followed by hands-on training where participants will perform use case scenarios using software established by the organizers. This will include an introduction to the basics of using command line interfaces, Python installation, working with Docker/Singularity containers, Datalad/Git, and BIDS.

*SEMINAR 2 (25 min):*  Michał -- An introduction to version control, Git, DataLad  

*SEMINAR 3 (15 min):* Joanes -- Working with robust data structure (BIDS) and containers (Docker / Apptainer)  

*HANDS-ON 1 (1 h):* Michał (Aref, Markus, Joanes) -- Data Management for Neuroimaging with DataLad   

*HANDS-ON 2 (2 hrs):* Two breakout rooms:
